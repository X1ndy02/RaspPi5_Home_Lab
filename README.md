RaspPi5_Home_Lab

This is my First atempt to create a home lab

The goal was to build it from scratch so I can better understand how real systems actually run
Not just installing apps on already prebuild product, but running services properly, monitoring them,
securing them, backing them up, and fixing them when something breaks (on  amachine that ive build and designed moslty myslef)

It runs 24/7 and behaves like a small server.

All detailed documentations and photos are inside the docs folder:

- docs/1_software.md
- docs/2_hardware.md
- docs/3_monitoring_&_PowerMngmnt.md
- docs/4_security_&_backup.md

The goal when i first started was simple:

Build real operational experience, not just theory to drastically imporve knowladge (thought that its better then reading about it...)
